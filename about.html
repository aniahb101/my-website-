        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Aniah Brown and I am 24. I am a passionate individual who
          embarked on a journey into the world of development in 2023. My
          fascination with computers and the art of editing ignited the spark
          that led me to explore the dynamic and ever-evolving field of web
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          As someone who has always been captivated by the intricate workings of
          computers, I found myself drawn to the possibilities that coding and
          programming offered. The idea of creating, shaping, and optimizing
          digital experiences appealed to my curiosity and desire to contribute
          to the vast digital landscape.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my love for computers, my hobby of video and photo
          editing played a pivotal role in my journey. The creative process of
          crafting and refining visuals honed my attention to detail and
          cultivated a deep appreciation for the aesthetics of design. This,
          combined with the technical aspects of development, provided me with a
          holistic perspective on bringing ideas to life in the digital realm.
